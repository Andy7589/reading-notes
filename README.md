“Obstacles don’t have to stop you. If you run into a wall, don’t turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it, or work around it.”
**– Michael Jordan**

# **About Me**
Former Marine, I served for 4 years between 2012-2016. After my time in service, I attempted Software Development at Green River Comunity College for about 2
quarters before I fell behind on my work due to doctors appointments. Feeling discuraged, I stuck to what i knew best, security. 4 years later and although scared
beyond beleif, I am trying my hand again at coding with the growth mindset in mind.

## **Growth Mindset**
A Growth Mindset pushes you to succed. Many times we underestimate ourselves and in doing so we avoid challenges.
With this minset, we overcome any obstical thats put in our path. As a Marine, I've learned this first hand.
We are trainded with this specific mindset because on the field of battle, anything can and will happen. We
strive for perfection. We push each other to our fullest extent. When we can master our minds, we can master the world.

I remind myself every morning that:
1. I've survived the most brutal training of all U.S. Military branches.
2. Pain is a weakness leaving the body.
3. I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.
