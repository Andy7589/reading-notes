# **What is Markdown**
Markdown is one of many ways to edit personilize a web browser using word formats such as italics, pictures, links and something as simple as making a letter boldface.
You can also use markdown to orginize lists or even make to-do-lists.

For example:To-Do-List
- [x] Reading 01
- [ ] Reading 02

Another example: Numerical Organization
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

these are just a few ways of using markdown for a website.
