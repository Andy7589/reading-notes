# **!!Chapter 18: Process & Design!!**

*These are my notes from reading chapter 18*

## **Who is this site for?**
Every website should be tailored for the audience. Not just for me or the site owner. You must ask all the right questios like: 
- *Who is the target audience?*
- *Who are the target companies?*
- *Key motivations* 
- *Specific goals*
- *Why people visit the website*
- *What your visitors are trying to achieve*
- *What information your visitors need*
- *How often people will visit your site*

## **Getting your message across using design**
- Content
- Prioritizing
- Organizing

*These are some ways to get your message accross.*
