# **Operators and Loops**
*My notes for reading 08*

## **Comparison and Logical Operators**
You can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be. The result will be a Boolean: **true** or **false**.

**Here are some examples of code:**
- "==" is equal to
- "!=" is not equal to
- "===" strict equal to
- "!==" strict not equal to
- ">" greater than
- "<" less than
- ">=" greater than or equal to
- "<=" less than or equal to

## **Logical Operators**
Comparison operators usually return single values of **true** or **false**.Logical operators allow you to compare the resluts of more than one comparison operator.

**Here are some examples of code:**
- "&&" logical and
- "||" logical or
- "!" logical not

## **Loops**
Loops check a conditon. If it returns **True**, a code block will run. Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns **true**, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns **false**. There are three common types of loops:
- For
- While
- Do While

## **Loop Counter**
A **for loop** uses a counter as a condition. This instructs the code to run a specified number of times. Here you can see the condition is made up of three statements:
- Initaialization *(Var i = 0;)*
- Condition *(i < 10;)*
- Update *(i++)*
